This is an extended version of the analysis posted in the [rOpenGov blog]().

I have translated key terms from the Finnish data release to better
serve the international audience. Pull requests for additional

## Overall subscription costs 2010-2015



Based on the data collected by the Ministry of Education, Finland paid in total
128.9 million EUR subscription and other
fees on scientific publishing in 2010-2015. The average annual costs for in Finland were 21 MEUR in 2010-2015; this is one third of the annual costs for journal subscriptions in Austria that have been estimated to be around 70 MEUR by the Austrian research funder Zentrale Einrichtung zur FÃ¶rderung (FWF) ([Bauer et al., 2015](https://olh.openlibhums.org/articles/10.16995/olh.72/#B4)), and two thirds of the annual expenditure of 31 MEUR in [New Zealand](http://publicaddress.net/9549). Data for the top-10 publishers in the UK 2010-2014 is available in [Lawson, Meghreblian & Brook, 2015](https://olh.openlibhums.org/articles/10.16995/olh.72/#B45) ([Table 1](https://olh.openlibhums.org/articles/10.16995/olh.72)). During this period the UK paid altogether 4319 MEUR (rough estimate based on the exchange rate June 12, 2016) for the top-10 publishers, which is roughly half of the overall subscription expenditure in the UK based on the same article. The publisher-level information is available only for the top-10 publishers in the UK, whereas in Finland it is available for all 244 publishers. Finland paid 61 MEUR for the same top-10 publishers in the same period 2010-2014, which is  1.4% of the UK expenditure (sounds rather low?). 

Information for Finland is available by [agreement
type](table/cost_by_type.csv), organization type, and [subscription
category](table/cost_by_category.csv).

### Costs by publisher

Overall, the Finnish data covers 244 publishers ([see annual costs by publisher](table/cost_by_publisher_year.csv)). The left figure indicates the total subscription fees paid to the top publishers 2010-2015. Over one third of the total costs go to Elsevier, which has been often [criticized](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2014/04/24/elsevier-journals-some-facts/) for its huge [profit margins](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0127502). The costs are given per bundle, so we cannot compare average journal prices among individual publishers based on this data. A rough look at the number of subscriptions indicates that Elsevier has third most subscriptions (3.7%) but this is not very informative as the bundle sizes may vary greatly.

The total costs paid to scientific publishers by Finland have increased roughly 10% per year in 2010-2015 (annual increase is indicated in the left figure). The top-10 publishers correspond to 77% of the overall costs (right figure). See a separate table for full [annual costs by publisher](table/cost_by_publisher_year.csv).

### Costs by organization



The Finnish data collection includes 62 organizations ([see annual costs by organization](table/cost_by_organization_year.csv)). The universities ('yliopisto') are responsible of 80.4% of all costs (left figure); University of Helsinki had the highest total costs in 2010-2015 (24.4 MEUR; top institutions shown in the right figure).

As could be expected, the costs increase rather evenly across institutions.
